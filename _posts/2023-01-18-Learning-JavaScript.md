I am excited to announce that I am embarking on a journey to learn JavaScript! I have always been interested in coding and have been learning various programming languages, but I am particularly excited to dive into JavaScript.

JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used language that powers the front-end of websites and web applications, and I am eager to start building my own projects using it. I am also looking forward to learning about the latest features and advancements in JavaScript.

I plan to start learning JavaScript between now and the next 2-3 months and will be sharing my progress along the way. I am excited to see how far I can take my skills and what kind of projects I can create using JavaScript. This is going to be an exciting journey and I can't wait to see where it takes me.
