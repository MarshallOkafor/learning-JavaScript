I am excited to announce that I am embarking on a journey to learn JavaScript! As a prospective PhD (Doctor of Philosophy) student and researcher with primary interests in Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligent (AI) systems, and other Cloud technologies, I have always been interested in coding and have been learning various programming languages, but I am particularly excited to dive into JavaScript.

JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used language that powers the front-end of websites and web applications, and I am eager to start building my own projects using it. As a prospective researcher in the field of IoT, AI and cloud technologies, having a strong understanding of JavaScript will be crucial in developing and implementing new technologies. JavaScript is widely used in front-end web development and can also be used in back-end with technologies like Node.js, which is commonly used in IoT and cloud-based applications. Additionally, JavaScript has a large and active community that is constantly developing new libraries and frameworks for building cutting-edge applications. This means that I will be able to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in my field and develop innovative solutions using JavaScript.

I plan to start learning JavaScript between now and the next 2-3 months and will be sharing my progress along the way. I am excited to see how far I can take my skills and what kind of projects I can create using JavaScript. This is going to be an exciting journey and I cannot wait to see where it takes me.

Overall, learning JavaScript will be a valuable asset in my research and career in the field of IoT, AI, and cloud technologies. With the constant advancements and growing popularity of these technologies, having a solid understanding of JavaScript will open up numerous opportunities for me to work on cutting-edge projects and make a significant impact in the field. I am excited to embark on this journey and am interested to discover what lies ahead.
