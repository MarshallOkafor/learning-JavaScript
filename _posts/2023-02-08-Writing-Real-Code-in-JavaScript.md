title: "Writing Real Code in JavaScript"

I am excited to share the recap of my week-two learning experience of learning JavaScript.

Recall that in week-one, I learned a lot about the basics of JavaScript programming language. Some of these basics include variables, types, expressions and so on.
This week was mostly exciting for me because I started writing real JavaScript code, that is, a meaningful code that has a simple logic and is usable. I built a simple Battleship game using JavaScript. While implementing this little project, I was able to learn how JavaScript GETS input from a user via the web browser, performs CONDITIONAL operations (the game logic) on data, and DISPLAYS output to a user, again via the web browser. 

### The Battleship Game
The idea of the game is that the browser prompst the user to enter a guess (an integer) for a certain number of times. The game randomly generates integer numbers and compare each of them with the guesses entered by the user. At the end the display the score (a rating of the guesses) to the user informing them if they sank the battleship or not.
