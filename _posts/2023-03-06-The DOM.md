This week I learned about the Document Object Model famously known as the DOM. It was an exciting week because I started learned a great deal about the 
structure of the DOM and how web pages are manipulated using the concept of the DOM. Understanding of the DOM allows us to create dynamic web pages 
that react to events and update web pages on the fly.

### How the DOM works
HTML is markup and JavaScript is code. JavaScript is able to interact with our weg page via the DOM. The way the DOM works can be summarized in three steps
listed below:
1. When we load a web page on the browser, the browser renders the HTML markup and also create an object represention of the markup. The object representation 
contains objects and these objects are stored in the DOM.
2. JavaScript interacts with the DOM to get access to the elements. Through the DOM, JavaScript can retrieve the content of the elements and/or modify the 
elements.
3. When JavaScript modifies the DOM, the web page is updated dynamically by the browser.

### The DOM in action
Below is an example code on how JavaScript interacts with web page via the DOM.
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Secret Code Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Some secret codes -->
        <p id="code1">The eagle is in the</p>
        <p id="code2">The fox is in the</p>
        <p id="code3">snuck into the garden last night.</p>
        <p id="code4">They said it would rain</p>
        <p id="code5">Does the red robin crow at</p>
        <p id="code6">Where can I find Mr.</p>
        
        <!-- Link to our JavaScript code-->
        <script src="secretCode.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```
The simpe markup above describes a web page that holds some secret code using a ```<p>``` tag for each line. Each ```<p>``` tag has an ```id``` and that is what we are going to use in the JavaScript code to access the element and retrieve the content. See the code below:
```
// JavaScript code that interacts with the 
// secret code web page using the DOM
var code = document.getElementById("code3");
var secret = code.innerHTML;

alert(secret); // This will display the content of the tag with id code3
```
From the JavaScript code above, the ```document``` object uses the method ```getElementById``` with ```code3``` as its argument to access the ```<p>``` tag with that ```id``` and stores the value in the ```code``` variable. The ```code``` is an ```element``` object and we use its ```innerHTML``` property to access the content of the element. We asign the content of the element to a new variable ```secret``` and use the ```alert()``` to display the secret code on the browser.
