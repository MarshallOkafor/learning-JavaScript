This is a recap of my first week of learning JavaScript.

Most of what I learned was more on introduction to the JavaScript programming language. Many of the aspects touched were familiar to me as they had similar concepts to other programming languages. Some of these aspects include data types, variable declarations, comments, etc. Although I was able to refresh myself again with some of these programming concepts, I learned many new and interesting things about JavaScript, how it works, it syntaxes, code structure and others. Below are the things that I learned in the first week of my learning JavaScript 

#### How JavaScript Works
If you could recall, websites before now used to be static pages displaying contents to users. There is no interactivity on web pages, just static information shown. HyperText Markup Language known as HTML is used to build the content and structure of web pages. You use tags to specify the type of content such as paragraphs and headings. Cascading Style Sheet also known as CSS is used to add styling to the pages. These styles include fonts, colors, layout, etc. However, both HTML and CSS are used to only create static web pages with still contents.

With JavaScript, we can ingest interactivity and beahavior into our making pages making it more attractive and usable for our users. JavaScript allows us to react to events on our web pages like when a user clicks a button, grab input data directly on the page and manipulate them, validate input data on the fly. JavaScript enables powerful programmming behavior directly on the page resulting to a dynamic, interactive, and reactive web page.

#### The Browser Console
One interesting thing that I learned is that JavaScript code can directly be run from the browser console. Although, the console is expected to be used mainly for debugging purpose, it was fascinating to learn that we could test JavaScript code using browser console. Another interesting that I picked from is the shortcut to open Google Chrome console on MacOS using:

Mac
Command+Option+I

Windows:
Ctl+Shift+I
